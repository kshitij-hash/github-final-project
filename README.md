# Simple Interest Calculator

This calculator computes the simple interest based on the provided values for principal amount (p), time period in years (t), and annual rate of interest (r).

## Input

- **p (Principal Amount):** The initial amount of money.
- **t (Time Period):** The number of years the money is borrowed or invested.
- **r (Annual Rate of Interest):** The annual interest rate as a decimal.

## Output

- **Simple Interest:** Calculated using the formula `Simple Interest = p * t * r`.

## Formula

The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

$\\text{Simple Interest} = p \times t \times r $

## Example

If you have a principal amount (\(p\)) of $1000, a time period (\(t\)) of 2 years, and an annual interest rate (\(r\)) of 0.05 (5%), the simple interest would be calculated as follows:

$\\text{Simple Interest} = 1000 \times 2 \times 0.05 = 100 $

Therefore, the simple interest in this example would be $100.
